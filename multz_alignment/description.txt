total number of ultraconserved elements observed: 123

Algorithm:
My program works as follows. It first preprocess the data in
the attu machine, extract all those alignments that has more than
40 species and longer than 100 bps. Then using those output files as
secondary input to find the final results.

The result finding algorithm works as follows. It take an multiz alignment
block, find all the columns that have >= 40 identical nucleotide, assgin
them 1, and -4 for the rest columns. Using this array, it runs the linear
algorithm to compute the maximum length. Once the length is computed, if
there are less than 100 columns, it will be discarded.

For those with length >= 100, construct a bitmap for each column with
>= 40. Do a full bitwise AND for all the bitmaps as well as a full bitwise OR.
If the number of bits in the AND-ed result is >= 40, return the result (that gives the maximum number of species). 
Otherwise, do a XOR for AND-ed result and OR-ed result. All the possible species to be subtracted correspond to the
1-entries in the XOR-ed result. Recursively take each of those species out
and return the result with longest length (you can also return the result with largest number of species).
